# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Eagles Style Pong Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be an Eagles Style Pong game made in python with using turtles. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a Pong game with 2 paddles and a ball. I will use a persons YouTube video and make it my own by editing it a lot, and crediting this person.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am using the project from when I last took this class. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am doing it solo. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game working perfectly after I make some adjustments.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Getting a good grade for the project.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Getting a perfect grade and getting to skip the final. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will just be working in Python using turtle for this project and figuring out how to improve it.
